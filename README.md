- Explain the difference between regular expressions in infix notation and those in postfix notation?

    In computing, a regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern, mainly for use in pattern matching with strings, or string matching.Each character in a regular expression is either understood to be a metacharacter with its special meaning, or a regular character with its literal meaning. Together, they can be used to identify text material of a given pattern, or process a number of details of it that can vary from being very alike to a very general similarity of the pattern.For example find and replace feature on microsoft word is a tool almost everyone is familar with it finds words that are similar or identical to the key word given and replaces it with what ever the user chooses. Infix and Postfix notations are two different but at the same time similar ways of writing expressions. Though postfix expressions are easily and efficiently evaluated by computers, they can be difficult for users to read. Complex expressions using standard or normal parenthesized infix notation are often more readable than the corresponding postfix expressions. commonly users tend to work with infix notations and the convert them into postfix notation for easier computer processing vice versa if we recive a posfix notation we convert it to infix for the average user to understand. Computers are likely to use a stack to evaluate expressions and this is why postfix is often used as it is a great way to simply the expression using a stack-based processor or virtual machine for the computer. One advantage that postfix has over infix is that it is very easily implemented and does not have overhead of parentheses. Evaluating an expression in postfix notation requires scanning from left to right so you know what to do as soon as you encounter an operator in the expression string. Also, with postfix there is no complication of precedence of one operator over the other.To go into more detail Infix notations require precedence and rules to decypher and make the expressions clearer, or addition of extra parentheses that are not usually considered part of the notation. These expressions are the form of mathematical or arithmetic notation like most people are used to, for instance A + B * C . In postfix, the expression would be A B C * +. Again, the order of operations is preserved since the * comes immediately after the B and the C, indicating that * has precedence, with + coming after.
