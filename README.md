- Explain the difference between regular expressions in infix notation and those in postfix notation?

    Infix and Postfix notations are two different but at the same time similar ways of writing expressions.Though postfix expressions are easily and efficiently evaluated by computers, they can be difficult for users to read. Complex expressions using standard or normal parenthesized infix notation are often more readable than the corresponding postfix expressions. commonly users tend to work with infix notations and the convert them into postfix notation for easier computer processing vice versa if we recive a posfix notation we convert it to infix for the average user to understand.The main difference between infix and postfix is the sorting layer on witch has more priority, For infix notations the operator's are usually inbetween the operands and for postfix the operators are to the right of the operands or just after this happens after postfix has been applied to infix notations.to go into more detail Infix expressions are the form of mathematical or arithmetic notation like most people are used to, for instance A + B * C . In postfix, the expression would be A B C * +. Again, the order of operations is preserved since the * appears immediately after the B and the C, denoting that * has precedence, with + coming after.
